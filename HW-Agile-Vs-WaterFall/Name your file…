Agile and Waterfall HW
 

SDLC: It involves the lifecycle of software development through which expands the stages and improvising the development and  process of software in maintaining it.

Planning- is the beginning stages in how to define the requirements of the software and also determine an analysis of what inputs is key in making it feasible in making assurance that the needed requirements are there for the software.

Defining- It determines what needs to be their in order for everything to work in basically finding out the specifications of meetings the design and development of the project.

Product Architecture- It determines the structure and design of what will be involved in the software and also involves the presentation of the approaching the design of the software.

Building or Develop a Product- It defines the built up of the design in how it will be used in coding and program languages that help to define where the product in its direction of how it will make a difference in how it's processed

Testing a Product- This is basically observation through seeing if what you have in the stages works out the way it was to be designed and using a test to see if everything is in proper order.

The waterfall method is well defined and easy to follow

The similarities and differences in Agile and Waterfall.                          

Waterfall                                                                                                                                                              Gathering and Analysis- It involves the stages of getting all involved requirements and also involved testing the specifications of the information of the system.

System Design- It involves the design

The waterfall is a predictive stage unlike Agile whereas Adaptive approach

The waterfall is where it's based on predictions on having an objective on summarizing on having a strategic theory prior to having results

There is a time schedule on when a predictive measure is given by estimating a timeline on when something will be most likely complete

It's not good for long term projects and planning

It's easy to understand the planning method

It's simple to put a task in order

Similar is that both can be used for approaching a stage in development, it's just that both are done on a different planning method whereas one is forecast and the other one it's just no determination buy a lot testing

They both involve testing of how the stages are development but at a different path

Agile

Agile model is based upon Adaptive software methods

Agile different then a predictive measure of Water is that it's not pre-planned or forecasted, its very much the opposite whereas there is no predetermined measure on when something will be complete

There are test done throughout the ordeal so as to prevent anything from falling apart before the procedure comes to a close

It's a very thorough testing procedure to see what works and what does not work

Unlike the Waterfall model, there is an idealistic approach were with extreme testing to do whatever can to make sure the final design is implemented in a well-designed method.

The difference in a waterfall is that agile is not suitable for difficult arrangements

Agile is not well documented unlike Water which is well document

It's an advantage where you can have early approaches on how to handle things

Its effective for a team response

They both have a planning method but some of the plannings is uncertainty whereas test and measures to see where it can lead too is either predictive or rest involved

They both waterfall and agile have a review process to see how things can occur in the staging process but at a different level
